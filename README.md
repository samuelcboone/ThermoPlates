# ThermoPlates
A series of UNIX shell scripts from Boone et al. (2025) that utilises the Generic Mapping Tool version 6 command library (Wessel et al., 2019) to enable users to integrate thermochronology data with plate tectonic, mantle dynamics, and paleoclimate model outputs for interpreting long-term exhumation histories in a holistic Earth systems context.
